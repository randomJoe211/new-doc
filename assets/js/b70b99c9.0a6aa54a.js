Developers of the database product itself, developers of the tools surrounding the database product, and end-users of the database, all had to learn each product. When the SQL-89 standard was developed in 1989, the entire relational database market quickly focus on SQL-89. This greatly reduced the learning costs for the people mentioned above.\n\nGQL (Graph Query Language) assumes a role similar to SQL in the field of graph databases. Uses interacts with graphs with GQL. Unlike international standards such as SQL-89, there are no international standards for GQL. Two mainstream graph languages are Neo4j\u2019s Cypher and Apache TinkerPop\'s Gremlin. The former is often referred to as the DQL, Declarative Query Language.
